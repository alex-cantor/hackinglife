HackingLife is born from the urge of documenting the knowledge acquired in the cybersecurity field and the need of being able to retrieve it. 

But there is something else: I strongly believe that there is not much difference between fixing a broken faucet (or opening a lock, or studying the engine of your car, orâ€¦) and assessing an environment and describing its vulnerabilities. As a matter of fact, I spend my time doing all these things: fixing, repairing, and creating narratives (yes, writing too) in which magically all parts work together harmonically (or provoke the end of the world harmonically too). Tadam!

So, when it comes to HackingLife, the main purpose of this site is to shape up all these concerns in a way that makes sense for the sake of my own sanity.
