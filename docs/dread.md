# Microsoft DREAD

[Microsoft DREAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DREAD_(risk_assessment_model)). `DREAD` is a risk assessment system developed by Microsoft to help IT security professionals evaluate the severity of security threats and vulnerabilities. It is used to perform a risk analysis by using a scale of 10 points to assess the severity of security threats and vulnerabilities. With this, we calculate the risk of a threat or vulnerability based on five main factors:

- Damage Potential
- Reproducibility
- Exploitability
- Affected Users
- Discoverability
