# Index of downloads

These are some of the tools that I use when conducting penetration testing. Most of them have their own updated repositories, so the best approach for you would be to visit the official repository or download the source code. In my case, when dealing with restricted environments, there are times when I require a direct download of a previously verified and clean file. Therefore, the main goal of this list is to provide me with these resources when needed, within a matter of seconds.
