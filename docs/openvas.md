# OpenVAS

[OpenVAS](https://www.openvas.org/) by Greenbone Networks is a publicly available open-source vulnerability scanner. OpenVAS can perform network scans, including authenticated and unauthenticated testing.

Openvas stands for Open Vulnerability Assessment Scanner. It's based on assets (not on scans). These assets may be hosts, operating systems, TLS certificates... Scans are called here `Tasks`.

```bash
# Start OpenVAS
sudo gvm-start
```
