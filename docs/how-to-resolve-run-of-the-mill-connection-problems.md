# How to resolve run-of-the-mill connection problems

```bash
# Check connection
ping 8.8.8.8

# Check domain resolver
ping google.com

# If pinging 8.8.8.8 works but pinging google.com doesn't, check dns file resolver
	# Add a new line: 
	# nameserver 8.8.8.8
sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf

# Check wired connections
sudo service networking
```

## Prevent /etc/resolv.conf from updating

By default, NetworkManager  dynamically updates the `/etc/resolv.conf` file with the DNS settings from active NetworkManager connection profiles. However, you can disable this behavior and manually configure DNS settings in `/etc/resolv.conf`. Steps:

**1.**  As the root user, create the `/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/90-dns-none.conf` file with the following content by using a text editor:

```
[main]
dns=none
```

**2.**  Reload the NetworkManager service:

```
systemctl reload NetworkManager
```    

 After you reload the service, NetworkManager no longer updates the `/etc/resolv.conf` file. However, the last contents of the file are preserved.
   
**3.**  Optionally, remove the "Generated by NetworkManager" comment from /etc/resolv.conf to avoid confusion.


**Verification**

**1.**  Edit the /etc/resolv.conf file and manually update the configuration.

**2.**  Reload the NetworkManager service:
   
```
systemctl reload NetworkManager
````   

**3.**  Display the /etc/resolv.conf file:

```
cat /etc/resolv.conf
```

 If you successfully disabled DNS processing, NetworkManager did not override the manually configured settings.
