## Quick guide

Open a terminal windows: $mod+Enter. By default it will open horizontally.

Open vertically next window: $mod+v.

Open horizontally next window: $mod+h.

Select your parent container: $mod+a.
If you have a selection of containers, then you can do an action on them, like to close them.

To move the position of the tiled windows $mod+Shift+Arrows and move the windows around

Close a window: $mod+Shift+Q

Enter full-screen mode: $mod+F

Switch workspace, $mod+num. To switch to workspace 2, $mod+2.

Moving windows to workspaces: $mod+Shift+num where num is the target workspace.

Restarting i3: $mod+Shift+r.

Exiting i3: $mod+Shift+e.


## Config file

Located at ~/.config/i3/config

You can add your own configurations. 

In my case I've added a shortcut to lock the screen:

```
# keybinding to lock screen
bindsym $mod+Control+l exec "i3lock -c 000000"
```

Also, I've added scratchpad shortcuts

```
# Make the currently focused window a scratchpad
bindsym $mod+Shift+minus move scratchpad

# Show the first scratchpad window
bindsym $mod+minus scratchpad show
```
