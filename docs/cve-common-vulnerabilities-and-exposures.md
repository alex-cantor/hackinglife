[Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)](https://cve.mitre.org/) is a publicly available catalog of security issues sponsored by the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

Each security issue has a unique CVE ID number assigned by the CVE Numbering Authority (CNA). The purpose of creating a unique CVE ID number is to create a standardization for a vulnerability or exposure as a researcher identifies it.
