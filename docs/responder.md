# Responder.py - A SMB server to listen to NTLM hashes 

Responder is a LLMNR, NBT-NS and MDNS poisoner, with built-in HTTP/SMB/MSSQL/FTP/LDAP rogue authentication server supporting NTLMv1/NTLMv2/LMv2, Extended Security NTLMSSP and Basic HTTP authentication. 

Responder can do many different kinds of attacks. For instance we may set up a malicious SMB server. When the target machine attempts to perform the NTLM authentication to that server, Responder sends a challenge back for the server to encrypt with the user's password. When the server responds, Responder will use the challenge and the encrypted response to generate the NetNTLMv2. While we can't reverse the NetNTLMv2, we can try many different common passwords to see if any generate the same challenge-response, and if we find one, we know that is the password. We can use [John The Ripper](john-the-ripper.md).


## Installation


```bash
git clone https://github.com/lgandx/Responder.git
cd Responder 
sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Basic usage

```bash
./Responder.py -I [interface] -w -d
# -I: Set interface 
# -w: Start the WPAD rogue proxy server. Default value is False
# -d: Enable answers for DHCP broadcast requests. This option will inject a WPAD server in the DHCP response. Default: False

# In the HTB machine responder:
./Responder.py -I tun0 -w -d
```

All saved Hashes are located in Responder's logs directory (`/usr/share/responder/logs/`). We can copy the hash to a file and attempt to crack it using the [hashcat](hashcat.md) module 5600.

>**Note:**Â If you notice multiples hashes for one account this is because NTLMv2 utilizes both a client-side and server-side challenge that is randomized for each interaction. This makes it so the resulting hashes that are sent are salted with a randomized string of numbers. This is why the hashes don't match but still represent the same password.
