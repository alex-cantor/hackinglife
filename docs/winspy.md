# winspy - A tool to view windows properties in the system 


## Installation

Download it from [https://www.catch22.net/software/winspy](https://www.catch22.net/software/winspy#)

## What it does

Basically winspy allows us to Â select and view the properties of any window in the system.  WinSpy is based around the Spy++ utility that ships with Microsoft Visual Studio.

It allows us to retrieve passwords from password-edit controls.

Here an example:
