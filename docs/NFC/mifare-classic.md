## Mifare classic 

The MiFare CanaNFC-based NFC based chip following theÂ [ISO 14443AÂ 49](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_14443)Â standard. The memory of this chip (assuming we are talking about the Classic 1K) is divided into 16 sectors of 64 bytes each. Like most, if not all, NFC cards it also contains UID and other data. Each sector can contain 2 keys as well as access condition information. All of these sectors can be encrypted with the Crypto1 algorithm to protect the data from being copied. Each key in each sector can be used to open a door (or anything else) in a sequence that goes something like this:

1. Reader detects NFC card and sends out information to unlock at least 1 sector on the MiFare Classic chip
2. Assuming the MiFare classic is programmed for this door, it sends back the key and access conditions
3. The reader validates the key and access conditions it receives and checks if the UID of the key is valid or within a specified range
4. If everything is in order, the reader opens the door



### Cloning a MIFARE classic

Make sure that it's a MIFARE classic 1K card:

```
hf search
```

Lats line should return:

```
Valid ISO14443A Tag Found - Quitting Search
```


In this case itâ€™s a Mifare 1k card. Copy  the UID of the card, which weâ€™ll need later. From there we can find keys in use by checking against a list of default keys (hopefully one of these has been used):

```
hf mf chk --1k -f mfc_default_keys
```


Results: 

```
Found valid key:[ffffffffffff]  
```

This shows a key of ffffffffffff, which we can plug into the next command, which dumps keys to file:

```
hf mf nested --1k --blk 0 -a -k FFFFFFFFFFFF --dump
```

This dumps keys from the card into the file dumpkeys.bin. The output should be something like this:

```

[+] Generating binary key file

```


Now to dump the contents of the card:

```
hf mf dump --1k
```

This dumps data from the card into dumpdata.bin. The output should be something like this:

```

At this point weâ€™ve got everything we need from the card, we can take it off the reader.

To copy that data onto a new card, place the (Chinese backdoor) card on the proxmark:

```
hf mf restore 1
```

This restores the dumped data onto the new card. Now we just need to give the card the UID we got from the original hf search command:

``` 
hf mf csetuid --uid <UID>
```
