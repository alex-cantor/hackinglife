# Buffer Overflow attack

A buffer is an area in the RAM (Random Access Memory) reserved for temporary data storage. If a developer does not enforce bufferâ€™s limits, an attacker could find a way to write data beyond those limits.

A stack is a data structure used to store the data. Two approaches: LIFO and FIFO
Two methods: push (adds elements to the stack) and pop (removes elements from the stack)
