Server-side Template Injection vulnerabilities (SSTI) occur when user input is embedded in a template in an unsafe manner and results in remote code execution on the server. Any features that support advanced user-supplied markup may be vulnerable to SSTI.

Web applications frequently use template systems to embed dynamic content in web pages and emails. 

Example:

```
custom_email={{self}}
```

What we have here is essentially server-side code execution inside a sandbox. See for instance this entrudet performed on Burpsuite Repeater module with server-side template payloads:

This vulnerability typically arises through developers intentionally letting users submit or edit templates. Template injection can also arise by accident, when user input is simply concatenated directly into a template. This may seem slightly counter-intuitive, but it is equivalent to SQL Injection vulnerabilities occurring in poorly written prepared statements.

The 'Server-Side' qualifier is used to distinguish this from vulnerabilities in client-side templating libraries such as those provided by jQuery and KnockoutJS.

## Detect injection points

Have an extensive template expression payloads. Common examples:

```
a{{7*7}}
a{{bar}}b
```

```
$ curl -g 'http://www.target.com/page?name={{7*7}}'
Hello 49!
```

## Identify the templating engine

After detecting template injection, the next step is to identify the template engine in use.

Green and red arrows represent 'success' and 'failure' responses respectively. In some cases, a single payload can have multiple distinct success responses - for example, the probe {{7*'7'}} would result in 49 in Twig, 7777777 in Jinja2, and neither if no template language is in use.
