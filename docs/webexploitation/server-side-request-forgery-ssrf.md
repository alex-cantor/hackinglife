# SSRF attack - Server Side Request Forgery

Server-side request forgery (also known as SSRF) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to induce the server-side application to make requests to an unintended location. The attacker could create a request to internet or to the intranet, which can be used to port scan or probe a remote machine. Basically, it could allow an atacker to:

- Take control of a remote machine.
- Read or update data
- Read the server configuration.
- Connet to internal services...
