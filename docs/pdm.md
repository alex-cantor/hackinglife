## Installation

PDM, as described, is a modern Python package and dependency manager supporting the latest PEP standards. But it is more than a package manager. It boosts your development workflow in various aspects. The most significant benefit is it installs and manages packages in a similar way to npm that doesn't need to create a virtualenv at all

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pdm-project/pdm/main/install-pdm.py | python3 -
```
