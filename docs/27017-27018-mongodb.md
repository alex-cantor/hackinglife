MongoDB is an open source database management system (DBMS) that uses a document-oriented database model which supports various forms of data. 

## To connect to a MongoDB

By default mongo does not require password. Admin is a common mongo database default admin user.

```bash
mongo <IP>
mongo <HOST>:<PORT>
mongo <HOST>:<PORT>/<DB>
mongo <database> -u <username> -p '<password>'
```

## Some MongoDB commnads:

```mongo
show dbs
use <db>
show collections
db.<collection>.find() #Dump the collection
db.<collection>.count() #Number of records of the collection
db.current.find({"username":"admin"}) #Find in current db the username admin

# We can dump the contents of the documents present in the flag collection by using the db.collection.find() command. Let's replace the collection name flag in the command and also use pretty() in order to receive the output in a beautified format.
```
