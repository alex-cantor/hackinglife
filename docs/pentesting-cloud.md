# Pentesting cloud

## Enumerate instances

[insp3ctor](https://github.com/brianwarehime/inSp3ctor): the AWS bucket finder.

[Blobs](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/blobs/) are Microsoft’s unstructured data storage objects. Most frequently, we’re seeing them used for serving static public data, but we have found blobs being used to store sensitive information (config files, database backups, credentials). Given that Google is indexing about 1.2 million PDFs from the Azure “blob.core.windows.net” subdomain, I think there’s pretty decent surface area here.
