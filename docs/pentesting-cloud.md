# Pentesting cloud

## Enumerate instances

[insp3ctor](https://github.com/brianwarehime/inSp3ctor): the AWS bucket finder.

[Blobs](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/blobs/) are Microsoft’s unstructured data storage objects. Most frequently, we’re seeing them used for serving static public data, but we have found blobs being used to store sensitive information (config files, database backups, credentials). Given that Google is indexing about 1.2 million PDFs from the Azure “blob.core.windows.net” subdomain, I think there’s pretty decent surface area here. 


## Basic concepts

### Blob storage
Blob storage is a type of cloud storage for unstructured data. A "blob," which is short for **Binary Large Object**, is a mass of data in binary form that does not necessarily conform to any file format. Blob storage keeps these masses of data in non-hierarchical storage areas called data lakes.


### ETL

ETL, which stands for extract, transform and load, is a data integration process that combines data from multiple data sources into a single, consistent data store that is loaded into a data warehouse or other target system.
