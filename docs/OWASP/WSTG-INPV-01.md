ReflectedÂ Cross-site Scripting (XSS) occur when an attacker injects browser executable code within a single HTTP response. The injected attack is not stored within the application itself; it is non-persistent and only impacts users who open a maliciously crafted link or third-party web page. When a web application is vulnerable to this type of attack, it will pass unvalidated input sent through requests back to the client.

## Causes

This vulnerable PHP code in a welcome page may lead to an XSS attack:

```php
<?php $name = @$_GET['name']; ?>

Welcome <?=$name?>

```
