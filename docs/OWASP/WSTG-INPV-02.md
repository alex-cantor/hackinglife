Stored cross-site scripting is a vulnerability where an attacker is able to inject Javascript code into a web applicationâ€™s database or source code via an input that is not sanitized. For example, if an attacker is able to inject a malicious XSS payload in to a webpage on a website without proper sanitization, the XSS payload injected in to the webpage will be  executed by the browser of anyone that visits that webpage.


## Causes

This vulnerable PHP code in a welcome page may lead to a stored XSS attack:

```php
<?php 
$file  = 'newcomers.log';
if(@$_GET['name']){
	$current = file_get_contents($file);
	$current .= $_GET['name']."\n";
	//store the newcomer
	file_put_contents($file, $current);
}
//If admin show newcomers
if(@$_GET['admin']==1)
	echo file_get_contents($file);
?>

Welcome <?=$name?>
```
