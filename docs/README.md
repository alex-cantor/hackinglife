# Welcome to Hacking Life!

HackingLife is born from the urge to document the knowledge acquired in the cybersecurity field and the need of being able to retrieve it. 

But there is something else: I strongly believe there is not much difference between fixing a broken faucet (or opening a lock, or studying the engine of your car, or walking in the countryside, orâ€¦) and assessing an environment and describing its vulnerabilities. As a matter of fact, I spend my time doing all these things: fixing, repairing, and creating narratives (yes, writing too) in which magically all parts work together harmonically (or provoke the end of the world harmonically too). Tadam! 

## Second brain

It's quite intriguing how brains work because it doesn't matter how much information and resources you have available on the Internet, still, this is **something you need to do for and by yourself** if you want to understand in a deep sense what you are doing, keep track of it and so on.

So to be more than clear again: the main reason for this repository to exist is purely selfish. It's me being able to retrieve my notes and build upon them a second brain. Therefore, there is no intention of being exhaustive or giving thoughful explanations about how things work on a deep level.

## Acknowledgments

Nevertheless (and to be fair) this idea is deeply inspired by [Lyz-code](https://github.com/lyz-code) and their [Blue book](https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/). Thanks to this inspiring, polished, and... overwhelming repository I've found a way to start making sense of all my notes. Kudos!
