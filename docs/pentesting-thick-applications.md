# Pentesting Thick client Applications

Thick clients applications  are the applications that are run as standalone applications on the desktop.  Thick clients have two attack surfaces:

- Static. 
- Dynamic.

They are quite different from web services in the sense that thick applications, most of the tasks are performed at the client end, so these apps heavily depend on client's system resources like CPU, RAM or memory, for instance.

They are usually written in these languages:

- .NET
- C/C++
- Java applets etc
- Native android / IOS mobile applications: Obtictive C, swift 
- and more

They are considered old, but still might be found in some organizations.

## Basic Architecture

- 2-Tier Architecture: EXE/web-based launcher / java-based app + database. Business logic will be in the application. The app directly communicates to the database server.
- 3-Tier Architecture: EXE + server + database. Business logic can be move to the server so security findings will be less common. These apps don't have proxy settings in them so for sending traffic to a proxy server, some changes need to be done in the system host file.

## Basic Lab setup

1. Installing: 

VirtualBox with two windows machines:
Download windows machine from [https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/virtual-machines/](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/virtual-machines/)

Windows machine VM1 will have these apps installed:

- SQL Server Express 2008.
- SQL Server Management Studio.
- Filezilla FTP Server.

Windows machine VM2 will have these apps installed:

- Damn Vulnerable Thick Client Application (DVTA).


2. Capturing the traffic


## Pentesting it

### Determine its language

You can use [dnsSpy](dnspy.md) to determine if application is .NET executables or native code. If DNSpy decompiles the file .exe, then it means that’s .NET executable. 


## Determine if credentials are saved

We have several tools for that:

- [WinSpy](winspy.md).
- [Window Detective](https://windowdetective.sourceforge.net/index.html)

## Intercept traffic of application

And for that you can use: 

- Burp
- Wireshark
- EchoMirage (it’s for application which are not using HTTP protocol)
- By modifying .config files in app folder
