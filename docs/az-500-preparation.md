These are some of the requirements for facing the az-500 highlighted by some experts:

- Have previously taken the Azure Administrator: AZ-103/104 course.
- A minimum of 1 year experience with Azure.
- Understand concepts of virtual machines, resource groups and Azure AD.

Since I only had two vouchers for azure certifications in 2023 and I had already spent one on the [AZ-900](az-900-preparation.md), and I  focused myself on the AZ-500, but first I completed the AZ-104 trainings. [These are my notes for this AZ-104 not-certificated learning](az-104-preparation.md).


## Differences between the AZ-500 and the SC-900 certification

The [Exam AZ-500: Microsoft Azure Security Technologies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/exams/az-500/ "learn.microsoft.com") is focused on Azure Security Engineer implements, manages, and monitors security for resources in Azure, multi-cloud, and hybrid environments as part of an end-to-end infrastructure. This Certification contains security components and configurations to protect identity & access, data, applications, and networks.

Regarding the [Exam SC-900: Microsoft Security, Compliance, and Identity Fundamentals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/exams/sc-900/ "learn.microsoft.com") is targeted to those looking to familiarize themselves with the fundamentals of security, compliance, and identity (SCI) across cloud-based and related Microsoft services. This is a broad audience that may include business stakeholders, new or existing IT professionals, or students who have an interest in Microsoft security, compliance, and identity solutions.
