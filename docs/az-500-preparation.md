## Introduction

These are some of the requirements for facing the az-500 highlighted by some experts:

- Have previously taken the Azure Administrator: AZ-103/104 course.
- A minimum of 1 year experience with Azure.
- Understand concepts of virtual machines, resource groups and Azure AD.

Since I only have two vouchers for azure certifications and I've already spent one on the [AZ-900](az-900-preparation.md), and I really want to focus on the AZ-500, I will complete the AZ-104 trainings like I was going to pass their exam and later on proceed to AZ-500 even though I don't have the official certificate for the AZ-104. [These are my notes for this AZ-104 not-certificated learning](az-104-preparation.md).
