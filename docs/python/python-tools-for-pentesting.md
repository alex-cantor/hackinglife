# Python tools for pentesting

Tools and techniques to achieve:

- Coding your own reverse shell (TCP+HTTP).
- Exfiltrating data from victim's machine.
- Using anonymous shell by abusing Twitter, Google Form and Sourceforge.
- Hacking passwords with different techniques: code a Keylogger, perform Clipboard Hijacking.
- Bypassing some firewall by including cryptography encryption in your script shells (AES,RSA,XOR)   
- Writing scripts to perform privilege escalation on windows by abusing a weak service. And more.

## Tools

### pyinstaller

PyInstaller bundles a Python application and all its dependencies into a single package. The user can run the packaged app without installing a Python interpreter or any modules.

See [pyinstaller](../pyinstaller.md).


### py2exe

This setup file will convert the python script scsiaccess.py into an exe file:

```python
from distutils.core import setup
import py2exe, sys, os

sys.arg.append("py2exe")
setup(
	  options = {'py2exe': {'bundle_files': 1}},
	  windows = [ {'script': "scsiaccess.py"}],
	  zipfule = None
)
```



### Inmunity Debuger
 
See [Inmunity Debugger](../inmunity-debugger.md).
