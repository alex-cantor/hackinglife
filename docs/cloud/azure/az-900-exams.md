**Explanation**: Azure Security Center - unified security management and threat protection; a security dashboard inside Azure Portal. See: [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/security-center/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/security-center/)

#### Question 6: What is a DDoS attack?

- A denial of service attack that sends so much traffic to a network that it cannot respond fast enough; legitimate users become unable to use the service
- An attempt to read the contents of a web page from another website, thereby stealing the user's private information
- An attempt to send SQL commands to the server in a way that it will execute them against the database
- An attempt to guess a user's password through brute force methods
   
**Explanation**: Distributed Denial of Service attacks (DDoS) -a type of attack that originates from the Internet that attempts to overwhelm a network with millions of packets of bad traffic that aims to prevent legitimate traffic from getting through. See: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/ddos-protection-overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/ddos-protection-overview)

#### Question 7: In the context of cloud computing and Azure services, how would you define 'compute resources'?

- They include all resources listed in the Azure Marketplace.
- They are resources that execute tasks requiring CPU cycles.
- They refer exclusively to Virtual Machines.
- They encompass Virtual Machines, Storage Accounts, and Virtual Networks.

**Explanation**: The correct answer is "They are resources that execute tasks requiring CPU cycles". In cloud computing, the term "compute" refers to the amount of computational power required to process a task - essentially, it's anything that uses processing power (CPU cycles) to perform operations. This includes, but is not limited to, running applications, executing scripts, and processing data. While virtual machines (VMs) are a common type of compute resource, they are not the only type. Azure offers a wide variety of compute resources, like Azure Functions for serverless computing, Azure Kubernetes Service for container-based applications, and Azure Batch for parallel and high-performance computing tasks. So, the definition of compute resources is broader than just VMs or certain resources listed in the Azure Marketplace. It also includes more than VMs, Storage Accounts, and Virtual Networks, as these other resources (storage and networking) have distinct roles separate from the compute resources. Storage accounts deal with data storage while virtual networks are concerned with networking aspects in Azure, not with performing tasks that require CPU cycles. Therefore, "They are resources that execute tasks requiring CPU cycles" is the most accurate answer. See: [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/product-categories/compute/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/product-categories/compute/)

#### Question 8: Which Azure Service contains pre-built machine learning models that you can use in your own code, using an API?

- Cognitive Services
- Azure Functions
- Azure Blueprints
- App Services

**Explanation**: Cognitive Services is an API that Azure provides, that gives access to a set of pre-built machine learning models including vision services, speech services, knowledge management and chat bots.

#### Question 9: In Microsoft Azure, what is the maximum number of virtual machines that can be included in a single Virtual Machine Scale Set, as per Azure's standard guidelines and capabilities?

- 10000
- 1000
- Unlimited
- 500

**Explanation**: The correct answer is 1000. Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets are a service provided by Azure that allows you to manage, scale, and distribute large numbers of identical virtual machines. As per the limitations set by Microsoft Azure, a single Virtual Machine Scale Set can support up to 1000 VM instances. This capacity allows for high availability and network load balancing across a large number of virtual machines, providing a robust and efficient solution for applications that require heavy compute resources. However, if you are using custom VM images, this limit decreases to 600 instances. This functionality is part of Azure's Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offerings, providing flexibility and scalability to businesses and developers. See: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/overview)

#### Question 10: What feature within Azure will make recommendations to you about reducing cost on your account?

- Azure Service Health
- Azure Security Center
- Azure Advisor
- Azure Dashboard  

**Explanation**: Azure Advisor analyzes your account usage and makes recommendations for you based on its set rules. See: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/advisor/advisor-overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/advisor/advisor-overview)

#### Question 11: Your organization has implemented an Azure Policy that restricts the type of Virtual Machine instances you can use. How can you create a VM that is blocked by the policy?

- Use an account that has Contributor or above permissions to the resource group
- Subscription Owners (Administrators) can create resources regardless of what the policy restricts
- The only way is to remove the policy, create the resource and add the policy back

**Explanation**:  You cannot perform a task that violates policy, so you have to remove the policy in order to perform the task. See: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/overview)

#### Question 12: You have decided to subscribe to Azure DDoS Protection at the IP Protection Tier. This provides advanced protection to defend against DDoS attacks. What type of DDoS attack does DDoS Protection NOT protect against?

- Transport (L4) level attacks
- Application (L7) level attacks
- Network (L3) level attacks

**Explanation**: The correct answer is "Application level attacks": 

- **Network-level attacks** are attacks that target the network infrastructure, such as the routers and switches that connect your Azure resources to the internet. Azure DDoS Protection IP Protection Tier can protect against network-level attacks by absorbing and rerouting excessive traffic, and by scrubbing malicious traffic.
    
- **Transport-level attacks** are attacks that target the transport layer of the network protocol stack, such as TCP and UDP. Azure DDoS Protection IP Protection Tier can protect against transport-level attacks by absorbing and rerouting excessive traffic, and by scrubbing malicious traffic.
    
- **Application-level attacks** are attacks that target the application layer of the network protocol stack, such as HTTP and DNS. Azure DDoS Protection IP Protection Tier **does not** protect against application-level attacks, because it is designed to protect against network and transport-level attacks.
    
To protect against application-level attacks, you need to use a web application firewall (WAF). A WAF is a software appliance that sits in front of your application and filters out malicious traffic. WAFs can be configured to protect against a wide variety of application-level attacks, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and denial of service attacks. See: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/ddos-protection-overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/ddos-protection-overview)

#### Question 13: Which of the following characteristics of a cloud-based system primarily contributes to its elasticity?

- The system's ability to recover automatically after a crash.
- The system's ability to dynamically increase and decrease capacity based on real-time demand.
- The system's ability to maintain availability while updates are being implemented.
- The system's ability to withstand denial-of-service attacks.

**Explanation**:  The correct answer is "The ability to increase and reduce capacity based on actual demand." This characteristic refers to the concept of **elasticity** in cloud computing. An elastic system **is one that can automatically adjust its resources** (compute, storage, etc.) in response to changing workloads and demands. This is done to ensure optimal performance and cost-effectiveness. When demand increases, the system can scale out by adding more resources, and when demand decreases, it can scale in by reducing resources, all without significant manual intervention. The other options, while important for overall system robustness, do not define elasticity. Withstanding denial of service attacks pertains to security, maintaining availability during updates refers to zero-downtime deployment or high availability, and self-healing after a crash refers to resilience or fault tolerance. None of these are about dynamically adjusting capacity based on demand, which is the hallmark of an elastic system. See: [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-elastic-computing/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-elastic-computing/)

#### Question 14: Logic apps, functions, and service fabric are all examples of what model of compute within Azure?

- SaaS model
- App Services Model
- IaaS model
- Serverless model

**Explanation**: The correct answer is the Serverless model. Azure Logic Apps, Azure Functions, and Azure Service Fabric are all examples of serverless computing in Azure. Serverless computing is a cloud computing model where the cloud provider automatically manages the provisioning and allocation of servers, hence the term "serverless". The serverless model allows developers to focus on writing the code and business logic rather than worrying about the underlying infrastructure, its setup, maintenance, scaling, and capacity planning. 

- Azure Logic Apps is a cloud service that allows developers to build workflows that integrate apps, data, services, and systems. 
- Azure Functions is an event-driven, compute-on-demand experience that extends the existing Azure application platform with capabilities to implement code triggered by events occurring in Azure or third-party services. 
- Azure Service Fabric is a distributed systems platform that makes it easy to package, deploy, and manage scalable and reliable microservices.

In contrast, IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) refers to cloud-based services where you rent IT infrastructure—servers and virtual machines (VMs), storage, networks, and operating systems—from a cloud provider on a pay-as-you-go basis. SaaS (Software as a Service) is a software distribution model in which a third-party provider hosts applications and makes them available to customers over the Internet, which doesn't align with the services mentioned in the question. The App Services model is a platform for hosting web applications, REST APIs, and mobile backends, but it's not strictly serverless as it doesn't auto-scale in the same way. See: [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/serverless/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/serverless/)

#### Question 15: What is a primary benefit of opting for a consumption-based pricing model over a time-based pricing model in cloud services?

- The ability to easily predict the future cost of the service.
- It always being cheaper to pay for consumption rather than paying hourly.
- Significant cost savings when the resources aren't needed for constant use.
- A simpler and easier-to-understand pricing model.

**Explanation**: The correct answer is "Significant cost savings when the resources aren't needed for constant use". In a consumption-based pricing model, also known as pay-as-you-go, customers are billed only for the specific resources they use. This model provides cost-efficiency for workloads with variable usage patterns or for resources that aren't needed continuously.

When compared to a time-based pricing model, where resources are billed on a fixed schedule regardless of actual use (for example, hourly or monthly), consumption-based pricing can result in significant cost savings if the resources are not used often or their usage fluctuates.

While the other options can be true in certain cases, they aren't inherently beneficial aspects of the consumption-based model. The cost predictability can be challenging due to the variable nature of usage (Answer 1), it's not always cheaper (Answer 2) as it depends on the resource usage pattern, and the simplicity of the pricing model (Answer 4) depends on the specific terms and conditions of the service provider. Therefore, the most accurate and generalizable benefit is the potential for cost savings with infrequent or variable resource use. See: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-consumption-costs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-consumption-costs)

#### Question 16: In Microsoft Azure, which tool or service allows for the organization and management of multiple subscriptions within hierarchical structures?

- RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
- Management Groups
- Azure Active Directory
- Resource Groups

**Explanation**:  The correct answer is **Management Groups**. In Azure, Management Groups provide a way to manage access, policies, and compliance for multiple subscriptions. They can be structured into a hierarchy for the organization's needs. All subscriptions within a Management Group automatically inherit the conditions applied to the Management Group, facilitating governance on a large scale.

**Resource Groups**, on the other hand, are containers for resources deployed on Azure. They do not provide management capabilities across multiple subscriptions.

**RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)** is a system that provides fine-grained access management to Azure resources but it doesn't inherently support the organization of subscriptions into hierarchies.

**Azure Active Directory** is a service that provides identity and access management capabilities but does not provide a direct mechanism for managing multiple subscriptions in nested hierarchies.

Hence, Management Groups is the correct answer as it directly allows for the management and organization of multiple subscriptions into nested hierarchies, which the other options do not. See: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/management-groups/overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/management-groups/overview)

#### Question 17: Which feature of Azure Active Directory will require users to have their mobile phone in order to be able to log in?

- Azure Security Center
- Multi-Factor Authentication
- Azure Information Protection (AIP)
- Advanced Threat Protection (ATP)
    

**Explanation**: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) - the concept of having something additional to a “password” that is required to log in; passwords are find-able or guessable; but having your mobile phone on you to receive a phone call, text or run an app to get a code is harder for an unknown hacker to get. See: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-mfa-howitworks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-mfa-howitworks)

#### Question 18: Who is responsible for the security of the physical servers in an Azure data center?

- Azure is responsible for securing the physical data centers
- I am responsible for securing the physical data centers

**Explanation**: Azure is responsible for physical security. See: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/physical-security](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/physical-security)

#### Question 19: True or False: Azure is a public cloud, and has no private cloud offerings

- TRUE
- FALSE

**Explanation**: The correct answer is FALSE. While Azure is indeed widely recognized as a public cloud provider, offering a vast array of services accessible via the internet on a multi-tenant basis, it does also provide private cloud capabilities. One notable offering is Azure Stack, an extension of Azure that allows businesses to run apps in an on-premises environment and deliver Azure services in their datacenter. With Azure Stack, you get the flexibility of using Azure’s cloud capabilities while maintaining your own datacenter for privacy, regulatory compliance, or other requirements. Additionally, Azure offers services such as Azure Private Link, which provides private connectivity from a virtual network to Azure services, and Azure ExpressRoute, a service that enables a private, dedicated network connection to Azure. So, contrary to the statement, Azure does have private cloud offerings along with its public cloud, making the statement FALSE. See: 

- [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-a-private-cloud/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-a-private-cloud/)
- [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/government/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/government/)
- [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/azure-stack/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/azure-stack/)

#### Question 20: Who is responsible for the security of your Azure Storage account access keys?

- Azure is responsible for securing the access keys
- I am responsible for securing the access keys
   

**Explanation**: Customers are responsible to secure the access keys they are given and regenerate them if they are exposed. See: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-keys-manage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-keys-manage)

#### Question 21: Which feature within Azure collects all of the logs from various resources into a central dashboard, where you can run queries, view graphs, and create alerts on certain events?

- Azure Portal Dashboard
- Azure Monitor
- Azure Security Center
- Storage Account or Event Hub


**Explanation**: Azure Monitor - a centralized dashboard that collects all the logs, metrics and events from your resources. See: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/overview)

#### Question 22: When establishing a Site-to-Site VPN connection with Azure, what kind of network device needs to be present or installed in your company's on-premises network infrastructure?

- An Azure Virtual Network
- An Application Gateway
- A dedicated virtual machine
- A compatible VPN Gateway device

**Explanation**: The correct answer is a compatible VPN Gateway device. In order to establish a site-to-site VPN connection with Azure, a VPN Gateway is required on your company's internal network. A VPN Gateway is a specific type of virtual network gateway that sends encrypted traffic across a public network, like the Internet. While the name might suggest it's a purely virtual entity, in practice, the term "VPN Gateway" often refers to a hardware device that's installed on-premises in your data center. This device uses Internet Protocol security (IPsec) to establish a secure, encrypted connection to the Azure VPN Gateway, which resides in the Azure virtual network. This setup allows your local network and Azure to interact as if they're directly connected. In contrast, virtual machines, virtual networks, and application gateways are other types of Azure resources, but they do not facilitate creating a site-to-site VPN connection. It's important to note that your company's internal network hardware and settings must meet specific requirements to support a VPN Gateway. See: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-howto-site-to-site-resource-manager-portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-howto-site-to-site-resource-manager-portal)

#### Question 23: Which of the following is something that Azure Cognitive Services API can currently do?

- Translate text from one language to another
- All of these! Azure can do it all!
- Speak text in an extremely realistic way
- Create text from audio
- Recognize text in an image

**Explanation**: Azure can do all of them, of course. See: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/welcome](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/welcome)

#### Question 24: Which of the following Azure features is most likely to deliver the most immediate savings when it comes to reducing Azure costs?

- Changing your storage accounts from globally redundant (GRS) to locally redundant (LRS)
- Auto shutdown of development and QA servers over night and on weekends    
- Using Azure Reserved Instances for most of your virtual machines
- Using Azure Policy to restrict the user of expensive VM SKUs

**Explanation**:  Reserved Instances often offer 40% or more savings off of the price of pay-as-you-go virtual machines. See: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/reservations/save-compute-costs-reservations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/reservations/save-compute-costs-reservations)

#### Question 25: In the context of Azure's high availability solutions, what is the primary purpose of Azure Availability Zones?

- They serve as a folder structure in Azure used for organizing resources such as databases, virtual machines, and virtual networks.
- They are synonymous with an Azure region.
- They allow manual selection of data centers for virtual machine placement to achieve superior availability compared to other options.
- They represent certain server racks within individual data centers, specifically designed by Azure for higher uptime.

**Explanation**:  The correct answer is: "They allow manual selection of data centers for virtual machine placement to achieve superior availability compared to other options." 

Azure Availability Zones are a high availability offering that protects applications and data from datacenter failures. Each Azure region is composed of multiple datacenters, and each datacenter is essentially an Availability Zone. They are unique physical locations within a region, equipped with their own independent power, cooling, and networking. By placing your resources across different Availability Zones within a region, you can protect your apps and data from the failure of a single datacenter. If one datacenter goes down, the resources in the other datacenters (Availability Zones) can continue to operate, providing redundancy and increasing the overall availability of your applications. It's important to note that these zones are not the same as Azure regions (which are geographical areas containing one or more datacenters), nor are they equivalent to resource groups (which are logical containers for resources deployed on Azure). They are also not isolated to specific racks within a datacenter, but rather spread across different datacenters in a region, offering a broader scope of protection.  See: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/availability-zones/az-overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/availability-zones/az-overview)

#### Question 26: Which of the following characteristics is essential for a system to be considered highly available in a cloud computing environment?

- The system must maintain 100% availability at all times.
- The system must be designed for resilience, with no single points of failure.
- It's impossible to create a highly available system.
- The system must operate on a minimum of two virtual machines.

**Explanation**: The correct answer is "A system specifically designed to be resilient, with no single point of failures". High availability in a system means that it is designed to operate continuously without failure for a long period of time. This is achieved by building redundancy into the system, eliminating single points of failure, and enabling rapid recovery from any failures that do occur. In other words, even if a component of the system fails, there are other components that can take over, allowing the system to continue operating seamlessly. While high availability often aims for close to 100% uptime, the claim of maintaining 100% availability is practically unrealistic due to factors like maintenance needs and unexpected failures. Also, having a minimum of two VMs may contribute to high availability but isn't a definitive requirement — it depends on the specifics of the system architecture. Finally, the assertion that it's not possible to create a highly available system is incorrect. There are established strategies and technologies for designing and operating highly available systems, and they are widely used in mission-critical applications across many industries. See: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/availability](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/availability)

#### Question 27: In the context of cloud computing, how is the benefit of 'agility' best described?

- It refers to the ability to swiftly recover from a large-scale regional failure.
- It refers to the ability to quickly respond to and drive changes in the market.
- It refers to the system's ability to easily scale up when it reaches full capacity.
- It refers to the ability to rapidly provision new resources.

**Explanation**:  The correct answer is "It refers to the ability to quickly respond to and drive changes in the market". Agility, in the context of cloud computing, refers to the ability of an organization to rapidly adapt to market and environmental changes in productive and cost-effective ways. It involves quickly adjusting and adapting strategic and operational capabilities to respond to and take advantage of changes in the business environment. The other options, while also benefits of the cloud, do not directly align with the concept of agility. Spinning up new resources quickly (Answer 2) or growing capacity easily when full (Answer 3) relate more to the cloud's scalability and elasticity. The ability to recover from a region-wide failure rapidly (Answer 4) speaks to the cloud's resilience and disaster recovery capabilities. While these aspects can contribute to overall business agility, they don't encapsulate the broader strategic meaning of agility - the capacity to quickly adjust to market changes, which can include shifts in customer demand, competitive pressures, or regulatory changes, among others. Hence, the ability to respond to and drive market change quickly is the most accurate answer. See: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/strategy/business-outcomes/agility-outcomes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/strategy/business-outcomes/agility-outcomes)

#### Question 28: If you wanted to simply use Azure as an extension of your own datacenter, not primarily hosting anything there but using it for extra storage or taking advantage of some services, what hosting model is that called?

- Public cloud
- Hybrid cloud
- Private cloud

**Explanation**: The correct answer is "Hybrid cloud." The scenario described in the question is a typical use case for a hybrid cloud model, which integrates private cloud or on-premises infrastructure with public cloud resources, such as those provided by Azure. In a hybrid cloud model, businesses can keep sensitive data or critical applications on their private cloud or on-premises datacenter for security and compliance reasons while using the public cloud's vast resources for additional storage, computational power, or specific services when necessary. This not only allows for greater flexibility and scalability, but also offers potential cost savings. In contrast, a purely public cloud model involves hosting all data and applications on a public cloud provider's infrastructure, and a purely private cloud model involves hosting everything on a business's own infrastructure or a rented, single-tenant infrastructure. The described scenario of extending an on-premises datacenter with Azure services fits best with the hybrid cloud model. See: [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-hybrid-cloud-computing/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-hybrid-cloud-computing/)

#### Question 29: In the context of cloud computing, a virtual machine (VM) is primarily associated with which type of cloud hosting model?

- Software as a Service (SaaS)
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)

**Explanation**: The correct answer is IaaS, which stands for Infrastructure as a Service. In the context of cloud computing, a virtual machine (VM) is typically provided as part of an IaaS offering. With IaaS, the provider manages the underlying physical infrastructure (like servers, network equipment, and storage), while the consumer controls the virtualized components of the infrastructure, such as the virtual machines, their operating systems, and the applications running on them. This is contrasted with the other options. In a Platform as a Service (PaaS) model, the consumer only controls the applications and possibly some configuration settings for the application-hosting environment, but does not manage the operating system, server hardware, or network infrastructure. Similarly, in a Software as a Service (SaaS) model, the consumer only uses the software and does not control any aspect of the infrastructure or platform where the application runs. Therefore, given that a virtual machine involves control over the operating system and applications within a cloud-managed infrastructure, it aligns with the IaaS hosting model. See: [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-iaas/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-iaas/)

#### Question 30: Which of the following best describes the primary benefit of a Content Delivery Network (CDN) in a cloud computing context?

- For a nominal fee, Azure will manage your virtual machine, perform OS updates, and ensure optimal performance.
- It mitigates server load for static, unchanging files like images, videos, and PDFs by distributing them across a network of servers.
- It enables temporary session information storage for web visitors, such as their login ID or name.
- It provides fast and inexpensive data retrieval for later use.

**Explanation**:  The correct answer, "It mitigates server load for static, unchanging files", is indeed the core benefit of a Content Delivery Network (CDN). A CDN stores copies of a website's static files on servers distributed globally. These static files could be anything that doesn't change frequently, like images, CSS, JavaScript, videos, etc. When a user visits the site, they are served these static files from the CDN server nearest to them geographically. This reduces the latency, as the data has a shorter distance to travel. Additionally, it reduces the load on the original server because the CDN handles a significant portion of the traffic. As a result, not only is the user experience improved due to faster load times, but the operational efficiency and performance of the original server are also enhanced. Therefore, CDNs are essential for sites serving large amounts of static content to a geographically dispersed user base. See: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cdn/cdn-overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cdn/cdn-overview)

#### Question 31: What is the name of the group of services inside Azure that hosts the Apache Hadoop big data analysis tools?

- Azure Hadoop Services
- Azure Data Factory
- HDInsight
- Azure Kubernetes Services

**Explanation**:  The correct answer is HDInsight. HDInsight is Microsoft Azure's offering for hosting the Apache Hadoop big data analysis tools. Apache Hadoop is an open-source software platform that supports data-intensive distributed applications. This platform enables processing large amounts of data across clusters of computers. Azure HDInsight is a cloud distribution of the Hadoop components from the Hortonworks Data Platform. It allows Azure users to process vast amounts of data with popular open-source frameworks such as Hadoop, Hive, HBase, Storm, and others. Additionally, the HDInsight service also supports R, Python, Scala, and .NET. So, it's not just limited to traditional Hadoop tools. Options like 'Azure Hadoop Services' and 'Azure Data Factory' are incorrect as Azure doesn't have a service named 'Azure Hadoop Services' and 'Azure Data Factory' is a cloud-based data integration service. 'Azure Kubernetes Services' is a service for managing containerized applications, not specifically for Hadoop. See: [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/hdinsight/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/hdinsight/)

#### Question 32: Within the landscape of cloud service models, how would Microsoft's Outlook 365 be best categorized?

- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- Software as a Service (SaaS)
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)

**Explanation**:  The correct answer is SaaS, which stands for Software as a Service. Outlook 365, part of Microsoft's Office 365 suite, is a cloud-based service that provides access to various applications and services, including email, calendars, and contact management, which are delivered over the internet. In a SaaS model, the service provider is responsible for the infrastructure, platform, and software, and ensures their maintenance and updates. Users simply access the services via a web browser or app, without needing to worry about the underlying infrastructure, platform, or software updates. This contrasts with Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), where the user is responsible for managing the operating systems, middleware, and applications, and Platform as a Service (PaaS), where the user manages only the applications and data. In both these models, the users have more responsibilities compared to SaaS. Since Outlook 365 is a software application delivered over the web with all underlying infrastructure and platform taken care of by Microsoft, it falls into the SaaS hosting model. See: [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-saas/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-saas/)

#### Question 33: Which major cloud provider offers the most international locations for customers to provision virtual machines and other servers?

- Microsoft Azure
- Google Cloud Platform
- Amazon AWS

**Explanation**:  Microsoft Azure offers the most extensive global coverage among major cloud providers regarding geographical regions. This allows customers to provision virtual machines, databases, and other services in various international locations closer to their user base, which can enhance performance, reduce latency, and comply with local regulations regarding data residency. While AWS (Amazon Web Services) and GCP (Google Cloud Platform) also provide many regions globally, Microsoft Azure has distinguished itself with the broadest regional availability. See: [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/regions/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/regions/)

#### Question 34: Which Azure website tool is available for you to estimate the future costs of your Azure products and services by adding products to a shopping basket and helping you calculate the costs?

- Azure Pricing Calculator
- Microsoft Docs
- Azure Advisor

**Explanation**: Azure Pricing Calculator lets you attempt to calculate your future bill based on resources you select and your estimates of usage. See: [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/)

#### Question 35: What is the name of Azure's hosted SQL database service?

- SQL Server in a VM
- Table Storage
- Cosmos DB
- Azure SQL Database

**Explanation**:  SQL Database is a SQL Server compatible option in Azure, a database as a service. See: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-technical-overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-technical-overview)

#### Question 36: True or false: You cannot have more than one Azure subscription per company

- TRUE
- FALSE

**Explanation**:  You can have multiple subscriptions, as a way to separate out resources between billing units, business groups, or for any reason you wish. See: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/decision-guides/subscriptions/](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/decision-guides/subscriptions/)

#### Question 37: Can you give someone else access to your Azure subscription without giving them your user name and password?

- YES
- NO

**Explanation**: Yes, anyone can create their own Azure account and you can give them access to your subscription with granular control as to permissions. See: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/overview)

#### Question 38: True or false: you can create your own policies if built-in Azure Policy is not sufficient to your needs

- FALSE

#### Question 39: In the context of Azure's Service Level Agreement (SLA) for virtual machines, which of the following deployment strategies would offer the highest level of availability?

- Deploying two or more virtual machines across different availability zones within the same region.
- Deploying two or more virtual machines within the same data center.   
- Deploying two or more virtual machines within an availability set.
- Deploying a single virtual machine.


**Explanation**: The correct answer is "Deploying two or more virtual machines across different availability zones within the same region".

Service Level Agreement (SLA) is a commitment by a service provider on the level of service - like uptime, performance, or other key metrics - that users can expect. Azure provides an SLA for various services, including Virtual Machines. A single VM, even with premium storage, provides a lesser SLA compared to VMs deployed in an Availability Set or across Availability Zones. While using an Availability Set (two or more VMs in the same datacenter but across fault and update domains) provides a higher SLA than a single VM, the highest SLA is provided when two or more VMs are deployed across Availability Zones in the same region. Availability Zones are unique physical locations within a region. Each zone is made up of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking. They are set up to be an isolation boundary - if one zone goes down, the other continues working. This distribution of VMs across zones provides high availability and resiliency, hence offering the highest SLA. See: [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/legal/sla/virtual-machines/v1_9/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/legal/sla/virtual-machines/v1_9/)

#### Question 40: What is the basic way of protecting an Azure Virtual Network subnet?

- Network Security Group
- Azure DDos Standard protection
- Azure Firewall
- Application Gateway with WAF

**Explanation**:  Network Security Group (NSG) - a fairly basic set of rules that you can apply to both inbound traffic and outbound traffic that lets you specify what sources, destinations, and ports are allowed to travel through from outside the virtual network to inside the virtual network. See: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/security-overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/security-overview)

#### Question 41: True or false: Formal support is not included in private preview mode.

- FALSE
- TRUE

**Explanation**: True. Preview features are not fully ready and this phase does not include formal support. See: [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/)

#### Question 42: True or False: Azure has the responsibility to manage the hardware in the Infrastructure as a Service model

- TRUE   
- FALSE

**Explanation**:  The correct answer is TRUE. In an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) model, the cloud service provider, in this case Microsoft Azure, is responsible for managing the underlying physical hardware. This includes servers, storage, networking hardware, and the virtualization layer. Azure ensures that these resources are available and maintained, providing capabilities like automated backup, disaster recovery, and scaling. The customer, on the other hand, is responsible for managing the software components of the service, including the operating system, middleware, runtime, data, and applications. This arrangement allows customers to focus on their core business and application development without worrying about the physical infrastructure's procurement, management, and maintenance. It's important to remember that the division of responsibilities may change in other service models like Platform as a Service (PaaS) or Software as a Service (SaaS), where the cloud service provider manages more layers of the technology stack. But for IaaS, the provider indeed manages the hardware, making the statement TRUE. See: [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-iaas/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-iaas/)

#### Question 43: What is Single Sign-On?

- When you sign in to an application, it remembers who you are the next time you go there.
- The ability to use an existing user id and password to sign in other applications, and not have to create/memorize a new one.
- When an application outsources (federates) it's identity service to a third-party platform

**Explanation**:  Single Sign-On - the ability to use the same user id and password to log into every application that your company has; enabled by Azure AD. See: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on)

#### Question 4: What would be a good reason to have multiple Azure subscriptions?

- There is one person/credit card paying for resources, and only one person who logs into Azure to manage the resources, but you want to be able to know which resources are used for which client project.
- There is one person/credit card paying for resources, but many people who have accounts in Azure, and you need to separate out resources between clients so that there is absolutely no chance of resources being exposed between them.

**Explanation**: Having multiple subscriptions can technically be done for any reason, but it only makes sense if you have to separate billing directly, or have actual clients logging into the Portal to manage their resources. For more info: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/subscriptions-licenses-accounts-and-tenants-for-microsoft-cloud-offerings?view=o365-worldwide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/subscriptions-licenses-accounts-and-tenants-for-microsoft-cloud-offerings?view=o365-worldwide)

#### Question 16: What is the concept of paired regions?

- Azure employees in those regions sometimes go on picnics together.
- Each region of the world has one other region, usually in a completely separate country and geography, where it makes the most sense to place your backups. Like East US 2 is paired with South Korea.
- When you deploy your code to one region of the world, it is automatically deployed to the paired region as an emergency backup.
- Each region in the world has at least one other region in which is shares an extremely high speed connection, and where there is coordinated action by Azure not to do anything that will bring them both down at the same time.

**Explanation**: Paired regions are usually in the same geo (not always) but are the most logical place to store backups because they have a high speed connection and Azure staggers the service updates to those regions. For more info: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/best-practices-availability-paired-regions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/best-practices-availability-paired-regions)

#### Question 17: What makes estimating the cost of an unmanaged storage account difficult?

- There is no way to predict the amount of data in the account
- The cost of storage changes frequently
- You are charged for data leaving Azure, and it's difficult to predict that
- You are charged for data coming into Azure, and it's difficult to predict that

**Explanation**:  There is a cost for egress (bandwidth out) and it's hard to estimate how many bytes will be counted leaving an Azure network. For more info: [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/storage/page-blobs/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/storage/page-blobs/)

#### Question 18: Why is a user id and password sometimes not enough to prove someone is who they say they are?

- User id and password can be used by anyone such as a co-worker, ex-employee or hacker half-way around the world
- Some people might choose the same user id and password
- Passwords must be encrypted before being stored
- Passwords are usually easy to forget

**Explanation**: The truth is that someone can find a way to get a user id and password, even guess it, and that can be used by another person. For more information on other ways to prove self-identification such as Multi-Factor Authentication: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-mfa-howitworks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-mfa-howitworks)

#### Question 29: Windows servers use "remote desktop protocol" (RDP) in order for administrators to get access to manage the server. Linux servers use SSH. What is the recommendation for ensuring the security of these protocols? 

- Disable RDP access using the Windows Services control panel admin tool
- Ensure strong passwords on your Windows admin accounts
- Do not enable SSH access for Linux servers
- Do not allow public Internet access over the RDP and SSH ports directly to the server. Instead use a secure server like Bastion to control access to the servers behind.

**Explanation**: You need to either control access to the RDP and SSH ports to a very specific range of IPs, enable the ports only when you are using it, or use a Bastion server/jump box to protect those servers. For more info: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bastion/bastion-overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bastion/bastion-overview)

#### Question 40: What are resource groups?

- A folder structure in Azure in which you organize resources like databases, virtual machines, virtual networks, or almost any resource
- Automatically assigned groups of resources that all have the same type (virtual machine, app service, etc)
- Based on the tag assigned to a resource by the deployment script, it is assigned to a group
- Within Azure security model, users are organized into groups, and those groups are granted permissions to resources

**Explanation**: Resource Groups - a folder structure in Azure in which you organize resources like databases, virtual machines, virtual networks, or almost any resource. For more info: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-portal)

#### Question 41: Which of the following services would NOT be considered Infrastructure as a Service?

- Virtual Network Interface Card (NIC)
- Azure Functions App
- Virtual Machine
- Virtual Network

**Explanation**: Functions are small pieces of code that you give to Azure to run for you, and you have no access to the underlying infrastructure. For more info: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/)

#### Question 42: What two advantages does cloud computing elasticity give to you? Pick two. 

- You can do more regular backups and you won't lose as much when that backup gets restored
- You can save money.
- Servers have become a commodity and Microsoft doesn't even need to even fix servers that fail within Azure.
- You can serve users better during peak traffic periods by automatically adding more capacity.

**Explanation**: Elasticity saves you money during slow periods (over night, over the weekend, over the summer, etc) and also allows you to handle the highest peak of traffic. For more info: [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-elastic-computing/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-elastic-computing/)

**Explanation**: Subnets is part of network security. For more info: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/network-best-practices](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/network-best-practices) and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model)

#### Question 44: What data format are ARM templates created in?

- JSON
- YAML
- HTML    
- XML

**Explanation**: ARM templates are created in JSON. For more info: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/overview)

#### Question 45: What does the letter R in RBAC stand for?

- Rights
- Review
- Role
- Rule

**Explanation**: RBAC is role based access control. For more info: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/)

#### Question 46: Which Azure service, when enabled, will automatically block traffic to or from known malicious IP addresses and domains?

- Network Security Groups
- Azure Active Directory
- Azure Firewall 
- Load Balancer

**Explanation**: Azure Firewall has a threat-intelligence option that will automatically block traffic to/from bad actors on the Internet. For more info: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/firewall/](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/firewall/)

#### Question 47: TRUE OR FALSE: Azure Tenant is a dedicated and trusted instance of Azure Active Directory that's automatically created when your organization signs up for a Microsoft cloud service subscription.

- TRUE
- FALSE

**Explanation**: Yes, Azure Tenant is a dedicated and trusted instance of Azure AD that's automatically created when your organization signs up for a Microsoft cloud service subscription. See: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis#which-features-work-in-azure-ad](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis#which-features-work-in-azure-ad)

#### Question 48: Why should you divide your application into multiple subnets as opposed to having all your web, application and database servers running on the same subnet?

- Each server type of your application requires its own subnet. It's not possible to mix web servers, database servers and application servers on the same subnet.
- Separating your application into multiple subnets allows you to have different NSG security rules for each subnet, which can make it harder for a hacker to get from one compromised server onto another.    
- There are only a limited number of IP addresses available per subnet, so you need multiple subnets over a certain number.
    
**Explanation**: For security purposes, you should not allow "port 80" web traffic to reach certain servers, and you do that by having separate NSG rules on each subnet. For more info: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/network-best-practices](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/network-best-practices)

#### Question 49: Which style of computing is easiest when migrating an existing hosted application from your own data center into the cloud?

#### Question 50: If you have an Azure free account, with a $200 credit for the first month, what happens when you reach the $200 limit?

- Your account is automatically closed.
- Your credit card is automatically billed.
- All services are stopped and you must decide whether you want to convert to a paid account or not.
- You cannot create any more resources until you add more credits to the account.

**Explanation**: Using up the free credits causes all your resources to be stopped until you decide to get a paid account. For more info: [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/free-account-faq/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/free-account-faq/)


### Test 4

#### Question 1: **All resources in a VNet can communicate outbound to the internet, by default.**

- No 
- Yes 

**Azure Virtual Network (VNet)** is the fundamental building block for your private network in Azure. VNet enables many types of Azure resources, such as Azure Virtual Machines (VM), to securely communicate with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks. VNet is similar to a traditional network that you'd operate in your own data center, but brings with it additional benefits of Azure's infrastructure such as scale, availability, and isolation. All resources in a VNet can communicate outbound to the internet, by default. You can communicate inbound to a resource by assigning a public IP address or a public Load Balancer. You can also use public IP or public Load Balancer to manage your outbound connections. To learn more about outbound connections in Azure, see [Outbound connections](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-outbound-connections), [Public IP addresses](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/ip-services/virtual-network-public-ip-address), and [Load Balancer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-overview)

#### Question 2: **Is it possible for you to run BOTH Bash and Powershell based scripts from the Azure Cloud shell?**

- Yes  
- No

Azure Cloud Shell is an interactive, authenticated, browser-accessible shell for managing Azure resources. It provides the flexibility of choosing the shell experience that best suits the way you work, **either Bash or PowerShell.**

#### Question 3: **As the Cloud Admin of your organization, you want to Block your employees from accessing your apps from specific locations. Which of the following can help you achieve this?**

- Azure Active Directory Conditional Access  
- Azure Sentinel - Azure Single Sign On (SSO) 
- Azure Role Based Access Control (RBAC) 

The modern security perimeter now extends beyond an organization's network to include user and device identity. Organizations can use identity-driven signals as part of their access control decisions. Conditional Access brings signals together, to make decisions, and enforce organizational policies. Azure AD Conditional Access is at the heart of the new identity-driven control plane. Conditional Access policies at their simplest are if-then statements, if a user wants to access a resource, then they must complete an action. Example: A payroll manager wants to access the payroll application and is required to do multi-factor authentication to access it.

#### Question 4: **What is the primary purpose of external identities in Azure Active Directory?**

- To enable single sign-on between Azure subscriptions. 
- To manage user identities exclusively for on-premises applications. 
- To allow external partners and customers to access resources in your Azure environment  
- To provide secure access to Azure resources for employees within the organization.

External identities in Azure AD enable organizations to extend their identity management beyond their own employees. This allows external partners, vendors, and customers to access specific resources within the organization's Azure environment without requiring them to have internal accounts. Reference: [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/external-identities/external-identities-overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/external-identities/external-identities-overview)

#### Question 5: **Your startup plans to migrate to Azure soon, but for all the resources, you would like control of the underlying Operating System and Middleware.** **Which of the following cloud models would make the most sense?**

- Infrastructure as a Service (laaS)  
- Anything as a Service (XaaS) 
- Platform as a Service (PaaS) 
- Software as a Service (SaaS)

**Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)** is a type of cloud computing service that offers essential compute, storage, and networking resources on demand, on a pay-as-you-go basis. IaaS is one of the four types of cloud services, along with software as a service ([SaaS](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-saas/)), platform as a service ([PaaS](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-paas/)), and [serverless](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-serverless-computing/). Migrating your organization's infrastructure to an IaaS solution helps you reduce maintenance of on-premises data centers, save money on hardware costs, and gain real-time business insights. IaaS solutions give you the flexibility to scale your IT resources up and down with demand. They also help you quickly provision new applications and increase the reliability of your underlying infrastructure. IaaS lets you bypass the cost and complexity of buying and managing physical servers and datacenter infrastructure. Each resource is offered as a separate service component, and you only pay for a particular resource for as long as you need it. A [cloud computing service provider](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/choosing-a-cloud-service-provider/) like [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-azure/azure-iaas/) manages the infrastructure, while you purchase, install, configure, and manage your own software—including operating systems, middleware, and applications.

#### Question 6: **Your company has decided to migrate its on-premises virtual machines to Azure. Which Azure Virtual Machines feature allows you to migrate virtual machines without downtime?**

- Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets 
- Azure Site Recovery 
- Azure Spot Virtual Machines 
- Azure Reserved Virtual Machines

The correct answer is Azure Site Recovery. **Azure Site Recovery (ASR)** is a service offered by Azure that enables replication of virtual machines from on-premises environments to Azure or between Azure regions with little or no downtime. This allows for the migration of virtual machines to Azure without any disruption to business operations. After replication to Azure, the virtual machines can be launched and used as if they were in the on-premises environment.

#### Question 7: **You've been planning to decommission your On-Prem database hosting Gigabytes of data. Which of the following is True about data ingress (moving into) for Azure?**

- It is free of cost  
- It is charged $0.05 per GB 
- It is charged $0.05 per TB 
- It is charged per hour of data transferred

Bandwidth refers to data moving in and out of Azure data centres, as well as data moving between Azure data centres; other transfers are explicitly covered by the Content Delivery Network, ExpressRoute pricing or Peering. #### Question 8: Correct

#### Question 8: **Which of the following is a Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) and Cloud Workload Protection Platform (CWPP) for all of your Azure, On-Premises, AND Multicloud (Amazon AWS and Google GCP) resources?**

- Microsoft Defender for Cloud  
- Azure DDoS Protection 
- Azure Front Door 
- Azure Key Vault 
- Azure Sentinel

Microsoft Defender for Cloud is a Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) and Cloud Workload Protection Platform (CWPP) for all of your Azure, on-premises, and multicloud (Amazon AWS and Google GCP) resources. Defender for Cloud fills three vital needs as you manage the security of your resources and workloads in the cloud and on-premises:

- [**Defender for Cloud secure score**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/secure-score-security-controls) **continually assesses** your security posture so you can track new security opportunities and precisely report on the progress of your security efforts. - [**Defender for Cloud recommendations**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/security-policy-concept) **secures** your workloads with step-by-step actions that protect your workloads from known security risks. - [**Defender for Cloud alerts**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/alerts-overview) **defends** your workloads in real-time so you can react immediately and prevent security events from developing.

#### Question 9: **Which of the following is a key benefit of using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) over traditional access control methods?**

- RBAC supports a wider range of authentication protocols than traditional methods. 
- RBAC provides centralized management of user identities and access. 
- RBAC allows you to assign permissions to specific roles rather than individual users.  
- RBAC provides stronger encryption for sensitive data. 


**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** is an approach to access control that allows you to manage user access based on the roles they perform within an organization. With RBAC, you can define a set of roles, each with a specific set of permissions, and then assign users to those roles.

One of the key benefits of RBAC over traditional access control methods is that it allows you to assign permissions to specific **roles** rather than individual users. This means that when a user's role changes, their permissions can be automatically adjusted without the need for manual updates. This can help to streamline the process of managing access control and reduce the risk of errors or oversights. 

#### Question 10: **Which of the following provides support for key migration workloads like Windows, SQL and Linux Server, databases, data, web apps, and virtual desktops?**

Use a [comprehensive approach](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/cloud-migration/) to migrating your application and datacenter estate. Get support for key migration workloads like [Windows](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/windows-server/), [SQL](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/migration/sql-server/) and [Linux Server](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/migration/linux/), databases, data, [web apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/migration/web-applications/), and virtual desktops. Migrate to destinations including Azure Virtual Machines, Azure VMware Solution, Azure App Service, and Azure SQL Database. Migrations are holistic across VMware, Hyper-V, physical server, and cloud-to-cloud migration.

#### Question 11: **Which type of scaling focuses on adjusting the capabilities of resources, such as increasing processing power?**

- Static scaling
- Vertical scaling 
- Elastic scaling
- Horizontal scaling

Vertical scaling involves adjusting the capabilities of resources, such as adding more CPUs or RAM to a virtual machine. It focuses on enhancing the capacity of individual resources. With horizontal scaling, if you suddenly experienced a steep jump in demand, your deployed resources could be scaled out (either automatically or manually). For example, you could add additional virtual machines or containers, scaling out. In the same manner, if there was a significant drop in demand, deployed resources could be scaled in (either automatically or manually), scaling in.

#### Question 12:  **What is the default action for a Network Security Rule (NSG) rule if no other action is specified?**

- Allow
- Block
- Deny 

The default action for an NSG rule if no other action is specified is **DENY**.

#### Question 13: **What is the primary purpose of a public endpoint in Azure?**

- To prevent communication between virtual networks.
- To enforce access control policies for resource groups.
- To restrict incoming network traffic to specific IP ranges. 
- To provide a direct and secure connection to Azure services.  

A **public** endpoint in Azure allows resources to be accessed over the public internet. It's used to expose services to clients or users who are not within the same network as the resource. Public endpoints are commonly used for services that need to be accessed from anywhere, such as web applications.
#### Question 14: **What is the minimum Azure AD edition required to enable self-service password reset for users?**

- Premium P2 edition
- Premium P1 edition 
- Basic edition
- Free edition

The correct answer is - Premium P1 edition is the minimum required edition to enable self-service password reset for users in Azure AD. **Reference:** [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/active-directory/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/active-directory/)

#### Question 15:  **An  _________________  is a collection of policy definitions that are grouped together towards a specific goal or purpose in mind.**

- Azure Collection
- Azure Initiative Correct)
- Azure Group
- Azure Bundle
 

An [Azure initiative](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/governance/policy/overview?WT.mc_id=itopstalk-blog-phschmit) is a collection of Azure policy definitions that are grouped together towards a specific goal or purpose in mind. Azure initiatives simplify management of your policies by grouping a set of policies together as one single item. For example, you could use the PCI-DSS built-in initiative which has all the policy definitions that are centered around meeting PCI-DSS compliance. Similar to Azure Policy, initiatives have **definitions** ( a bunch of policies ) , assignments and parameters. Once you determine the definitions that you want, you would assign the initiative to a scope so that it can be applied.

#### Question 16: **Which service would you use to reduce the overhead of manually assigning permissions to a set of resources?**

- Azure Resource Manager 
- Azure Trust Center
- Azure Policy 
- Azure Logic Apps


**Azure Resource Manager** is the deployment and management service for Azure. It provides a management layer that enables you to create, update, and delete resources in your Azure account. You use management features, like access control, locks, and tags, to secure and organize your resources after deployment. 
#### Question 17: **Which of the following authentication protocols is not supported by Azure AD?**

- OpenID Connect 
- NTLM 
- OAuth 2.0 
- SAML

Azure AD does support SAML, OAuth 2.0, and OpenID Connect authentication protocols. However, **NTLM** is not supported by Azure AD. NTLM is a legacy authentication protocol that is not recommended for modern authentication scenarios due to its security limitations. Azure AD recommends using modern authentication protocols such as SAML, OAuth 2.0, and OpenID Connect, which provide stronger security and support features such as multi-factor authentication and conditional access. Therefore, the correct answer is NTLM.
#### Question 18: **Which of the following is an offline tier optimized for storing data that is rarely accessed, and that has flexible latency requirements?**

- Cool Tier
- Infrequent Tier
- Hot Tier
- Archive Tier 

Data stored in the cloud grows at an exponential pace. To manage costs for your expanding storage needs, it can be helpful to organize your data based on how frequently it will be accessed and how long it will be retained. Azure storage offers different access tiers so that you can store your blob data in the most cost-effective manner based on how it's being used. Azure Storage access tiers include:

- **Hot tier** - An online tier optimized for storing data that is accessed or modified frequently. The Hot tier has the highest storage costs, but the lowest access costs.
- **Cool tier** - An online tier optimized for storing data that is infrequently accessed or modified. Data in the Cool tier should be stored for a minimum of 30 days. The Cool tier has lower storage costs and higher access costs compared to the Hot tier.
- **Archive tier** - An offline tier optimized for storing data that is rarely accessed, and that has flexible latency requirements, on the order of hours. Data in the Archive tier should be stored for a minimum of 180 days.

#### Question 19: **_______________ brings signals together, to make decisions, and enforce organizational policies. In simple terms, they are if-then statements, if a user wants to access a resource, then they must complete an action.**

- Demand Access
- Logical Access
- Conditional Access 
- Active Directory Access

The modern security perimeter now extends beyond an organization's network to include user and device identity. Organizations can use identity-driven signals as part of their access control decisions. Conditional Access brings signals together, to make decisions, and enforce organizational policies. Azure AD Conditional Access is at the heart of the new identity-driven control plane.

#### Question 20: **Which of the following services can you use to calculate your estimated hourly or monthly costs for using Azure?**

- Azure Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) calculator
- Azure Pricing Calculator 
- Azure Calculator
- Azure Cost Management

You can use the **Azure Pricing Calculator** to calculate your estimated hourly or monthly costs for using Azure. **Azure TCO** on the other hand is primarily used to estimate the cost savings you can realize by migrating your workloads to Azure.

#### Question 21: **Which of the following protocols is used for federated authentication in Azure AD?**

- LDAP 
- OpenID Connect
- OAuth 2.0
- SAML 

**SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)** is the protocol used for federated authentication in Azure AD. Federated authentication is a mechanism that allows users to use their existing credentials from a trusted identity provider (IdP) to authenticate with another application or service. In the context of Azure AD, federated authentication allows users to use their existing corporate credentials to authenticate with cloud-based applications and services. Azure AD supports several federated authentication protocols, including Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML), OAuth 2.0, and OpenID Connect. SAML is widely used for federated authentication in enterprise environments, while OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect are commonly used in web and mobile applications. **Reference:** [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/single-sign-on-saml-protocol](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/single-sign-on-saml-protocol)

#### Question 26: **______________ Infrastructure as Code** involves writing scripts in languages like Bash or PowerShell. You explicitly state commands that are executed to produce a desired outcome.

- Declarative
- Imperative 
- Ad-Hoc
- Defined 

There are two approaches you can take when implementing Infrastructure as Code.

- **Imperative Infrastructure as Code** involves writing scripts in languages like Bash or PowerShell. You explicitly state commands that are executed to produce a desired outcome. When you use imperative deployments, it's up to you to manage the sequence of dependencies, error control, and resource updates.
- **Declarative Infrastructure as Code** involves writing a definition that defines how you want your environment to look. In this definition, you specify a desired outcome rather than how you want it to be accomplished. The tooling figures out how to make the outcome happen by inspecting your current state, comparing it to your target state, and then applying the differences.

#### Question 27: **Which of these approaches is NOT a cost saving solutions?**

- Use Reserved Instances with Azure Hybrid
- Load balancing the incoming traffic 
- Use the correct and appropriate instance size based on current workload
- Making use of Azure Cost Management

Load balancing is done to increase the overall availability of the application **not** to optimize costs.

#### Question 28: **__________________ Infrastructure as Code** involves writing a definition that defines how you want your environment to look. In this definition, you specify a desired outcome rather than how you want it to be accomplished.

- Proactively apply data analysis to your costs
- Set spending thresholds
- Identify opportunities for workload changes that can optimize your spending

#### Question 36: **________________ asynchronously replicates the same applications and data across other Azure regions for disaster recovery protection.**

- Cross-region replication 
- Auto-Region Replication
- Auto-Region Replicas
- Across-Region Replication


Cross-region replication is one of several important pillars in the Azure business continuity and disaster recovery strategy. Cross-region replication builds on the synchronous replication of your applications and data that exists by using availability zones within your primary Azure region for high availability. Cross-region replication asynchronously replicates the same applications and data across other Azure regions for disaster recovery protection. Some Azure services take advantage of cross-region replication to ensure business continuity and protect against data loss. Azure provides several [storage solutions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy#redundancy-in-a-secondary-region) that make use of cross-region replication to ensure data availability. For example, [Azure geo-redundant storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy#geo-redundant-storage) (GRS) replicates data to a secondary region automatically. This approach ensures that data is durable even if the primary region isn't recoverable.

**When you** [**cancel an Azure subscription**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/cancel-azure-subscription#what-happens-after-subscription-cancellation)**:**

- A resource lock doesn't block the subscription cancellation.
- Azure preserves your resources by deactivating them instead of immediately deleting them.
- Azure only deletes your resources permanently after a waiting period.

#### Question 61: Yes or No: **Each virtual network can have only one VPN gateway.**

- No 
- Yes 

**VPN Gateway** sends encrypted traffic between an Azure virtual network and an on-premises location over the public Internet. You can also use VPN Gateway to send encrypted traffic between Azure virtual networks over the Microsoft network. A VPN gateway is a specific type of virtual network gateway. Each virtual network can have only one VPN gateway. However, you can create multiple connections to the same VPN gateway. When you create multiple connections to the same VPN gateway, all VPN tunnels share the available gateway bandwidth.

When you configure a virtual network gateway, you configure a setting that specifies the gateway type. The gateway type determines how the virtual network gateway will be used and the actions that the gateway takes. The gateway type 'Vpn' specifies that the type of virtual network gateway created is a 'VPN gateway'. This distinguishes it from an ExpressRoute gateway, which uses a different gateway type. A virtual network can have two virtual network gateways; one VPN gateway and one ExpressRoute gateway. For more information, see [Gateway types](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpn-gateway-settings#gwtype).

- Azure Storage accounts.
- Azure SQL Database. 
- All of the above. 
- Azure Key Vault.

Private endpoints can be used to access various Azure services, including Azure Storage accounts, Azure Key Vault, Azure App Service, and Azure SQL Database. By using private endpoints, you can connect to these services from within your virtual network, ensuring that the traffic remains within the Azure backbone network and doesn't traverse the public internet.

#### Question 67: **Which of the following scenarios is a suitable use case for applying a resource lock?**

- Preventing read access to a development virtual machine.
- Automating the deployment of resources using templates.
- Ensuring a critical storage account is not accidentally deleted.

#### Question 68: **Which of the following best describes the concept of "immutable infrastructure" in the context of IaC?**

- Infrastructure that is managed through a graphical user interface.
- Infrastructure that cannot be changed once deployed. 
- Infrastructure that is recreated rather than modified in place. 
- Infrastructure that is stored in a physical data center.

Immutable infrastructure refers to the practice of recreating infrastructure components whenever changes are needed rather than modifying them in place. This approach aligns with IaC principles, enhancing consistency and reducing configuration drift.

#### Question 69: **A(n) ________________ in Azure Monitor monitors your telemetry and captures a signal to see if the signal meets the criteria of a preset condition. If the conditions are met, an alert is triggered, which initiates the associated action group.**

- alert rule 
- preset rule
- preset condition
- alert condition

An **alert rule** monitors your telemetry and captures a signal that indicates that something is happening on a specified target. The alert rule captures the signal and checks to see if the signal meets the criteria of the condition. If the conditions are met, an alert is triggered, which initiates the associated action group and updates the state of the alert.

#### Question 70: **As the owner of a streaming platform deployed on Azure, you notice a huge spike in traffic whenever a new web-series in released but moderate traffic otherwise. Which of the following is a clear benefit of this type of workload?**

- Load balancing
- Elasticity 
- High availability
- High latency

Elasticity in this case is the ability to provide additional compute resource when needed (spikes) and reduce the compute resource when not needed to reduce costs. Load Balancing and High Availability are also great advantages the streaming platform would enjoy, but Elasticity is the option that best describes the workload in the Question.
Autoscaling is an example of elasticity.

#### Question 71: **Which of the following can repeatedly deploy your infrastructure throughout the development lifecycle and have confidence your resources are deployed in a consistent manner?**
