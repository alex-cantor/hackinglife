### ping sweeping
ping works by sending one or more special ICMP packets (Type 8 - echo request) to a host. If the destination host replies with ICMP echo reply packets, then the host is alive.


```bash
ping www.example.com
```

ping sweeping tools automatically perform the same operation to every host in a subnet or IP range.
