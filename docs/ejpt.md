## Subdomain enumeration

| Tool + Cheat sheet | What it does |
| ---- | ----------- |
| [Google dorks](google-dorks.md) | Google hacking, also named Google dorking, is a hacker technique that uses Google Search and other Google applications to find security holes in the configuration and computer code that websites are using. |
| [Sublist3r](sublist3r.md) | Sublist3r enumerates subdomains using many search engines such as Google, Yahoo, Bing, Baidu and Ask. Sublist3r also enumerates subdomains using Netcraft, Virustotal, ThreatCrowd, DNSdumpster and ReverseDNS.   |
| [crt.sh](ctr.md) | It collects information about SSL certificates. If you visit a domain and it contains a certificate you can extract other subdomain by using the View Certificate functionality. |
| [dnscan](dnscan.md) | Python wordlist-based DNS subdomain scanner. |
| [amass](amass.md) | In depth DNS Enumeration and network mapping.  |



## Footprinting & Scanning

| Tool + Cheat sheet | What it does |
| ---- | ----------- |
| [ping](ping.md) | ping works by sending one or more special ICMP packets (Type 8 - echo request) to a host. If the destination host replies with ICMP echo reply packets, then the host is alive. |
| [fping](fping.md) | Linux tool which is an improved version of the ping utility. |
| [nmap](nmap.md) | Network Mapper is an open source tool for network exploration and security auditing. Free and open-source scanner created by Gordon Lyon. Nmap is used to discover hosts and services on a computer network by sending packages and analyzing the responses.|
| [p0f](p0f) | P0f is a tool that utilizes an array of sophisticated, purely passive traffic fingerprinting mechanisms to identify the players behind any incidental TCP/IP communications (often as little as a single normal SYN) without interfering in any way. |
| [masscan](masscan.md) |  Masscan was designed to deal with large networks and to scan thousands of Ip addresses at once. Itâ€™s faster than nmap but probably less accurate. |
