- Kipo 
- Dionaea: fake an smb server. 
- T-Pot
- Elasticpot
- https://github.com/mushorg/conpot

Typical honeypots: old OS, outdated apps, registry keys, juicy files, ports, open services, change server banners, etc.

Metaphor for an active defense: leave an open house knowing that there are thieves  in the area.

Interesting acronyms:

- MTTD -  MeanTimeToDetect
- MTTR -  MeanTimeToRecover

Nmap and Nuclei already have options and flags for detecting honeypots. 

Some other honeypots: 
- Active Defense Harbinger Distribution (ADHD) 

## Installation


1. Use canary for creating an alert
 https://canarytokens.org/nest/ Use the module "# Create JS cloned website Token"

For instance, in js.

2. Use https://js.do/ to execute the code

You will get an email. Also you can create a webhook

Others:  RDP, Folder DNS (adding a DNS route in the location of the icon of the folder)
Create an user Service, that creates a service, enabled, but not authorized to login at any time. 

Simulate request LLMNR (Local Link Multicast Name Resolution). We can use invoke-honeycreds.ps1 from github.

Techniques to get the whoami without asking whoami.
